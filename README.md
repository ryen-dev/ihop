## Project Intro
Imagine a staircase, with steps numbered from 0 to 10. The top of these steps is nirvana whereas the bottom is literal torture. What step are you on? What step is everyone else on?
Our objective with this visulization is to allow you to try and get a better understanding of what factors can play into happiness levels of a country. 
<br>
This project was done as part of the Course Data Visualization (taught by [Angie Dag Hjort](instagram.com/fairyanimal/)) at [DIS Study Abroad in Scandinavia, Stockholm](https://disabroad.org/stockholm/). 
<br>
The website was built by Ryan with Observable Framework. The visualizations were built by Ryan, Gavin and Leonard
